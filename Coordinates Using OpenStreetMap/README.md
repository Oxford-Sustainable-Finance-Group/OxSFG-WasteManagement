## The code written in this file can be used to get coordinates of any geo tagged location using OpenStreetMap.

** To get the coordinates we need key and value pairs: 
  
  * For waste water treatement plants: tags = {'man_made': 'wastewater_plant', "name":"Waste water treatment plant"}  
  * This code save all data into csv file and it also save the polygon into shape file which can be visualised into any GIS application.
